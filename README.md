# CarStatisticsApp - GUI Demonstration

## Introduction
CarStatisticsApp is a graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to showcase a car management system. The application runs on Windows 10 and is developed using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition with JavaFX for the user interface, FXML for layout declaration, and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It is a demonstration of a user interface without actual database connectivity and uses static, hardcoded data to mimic the functionality.

## System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows 10
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (Recommended for development and running the project)
- Java Version: Java 17 "Corretto" (Amazon's distribution of the Open Java Development Kit)
- Build System: Maven (Ensures that all dependencies are correctly managed and the project can be easily built)

## Project Overview
